# fur
- A randomised (but structured!) fading slideshow of FUR by [Koji Kitagawa](http://kitagawakoji.com).  
- it starts very pastelly, and then very digitally deepfried, and then pastelly, and then mixes that up.
- watch it when you enjoy [REDACTED], project it on the wall of a nightclub, the possibilities are limited!
